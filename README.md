👾 Developer & AI Enthusiast

I’m a developer who builds, breaks, and rebuilds systems until they make sense.
Obsessed with clean logic, scalable design, and creating technology that solves real problems — not just pretty demos.

I learn fast, adapt fast, and push myself into uncomfortable areas where real growth happens.
My work lives in the space between software engineering, AI, and digital systems.
